# Overview üìù

I started my professional career as backend engineer. Creating enterprise scale backends, using Java, .NET, PHP, Node.JS, MySQL...
Later I discovered a new pasion for develop mobile apps with android, iOS and React Native. 
Lately I have been also focused on building front-end projects using React, NextJS and AngularJS.
I love writting clean code and build good architectures.
To sum up how I see myself, I would say this:

**I am not always brilliant. But when I am, it is awesome.**
